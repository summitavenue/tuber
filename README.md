<h1>Tuber</h1>
<p>This is the repository for the project Tuber which increases the accesability to Uber on all mobile platforms by allowing users to send text messages to a number which then makes an Uber request for you. This is a project for the Big Red Hacks team summit which is composed of team members of Charles Lai, Tech Kuo, Simon Zeng, and Philip Yan.</p>
